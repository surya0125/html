					Captain America is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
					Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby,the character first appeared in Captain America Comics 
					(cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed 
					as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most 
					popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the 
					Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics 
					revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.
					</p>
					<p>The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly indestructible 
					shield that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man 
					enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts
					in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was
					revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, 
					he remains a highly respected figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.
